In this repository, you will find a collection of projects I completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project highlights my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

Projects ðŸ”¹ Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸ Description: This project involves classifying iris flowers into different species using the Iris dataset. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

ðŸ”¹ Sales Prediction using Python ðŸ“Š Description: This project focuses on forecasting business sales based on advertisement expenditure. It includes data preprocessing, visualizations, and predictive modeling using Linear Regression.

ðŸ”¹ Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢ Description: Predicts whether a Titanic passenger survived based on features like age, gender, and ticket class. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

Each project demonstrates my ability to analyze data, develop ML models, and extract insights for real-world applications.Â ðŸš€
